  <h1 id="Programs_and_Portfolios"><b><u>Programs and Portfolios</u></b></h1>Project - may or may not be a part of a program<br /><br />Program Management - collection of more than one similar or related project; aligns similar/interrelated projects<br />   ◇ Obtain benefits not available by managing projects individually<br />   ◇ Focuses on project interdependencies<br />   ◇ Finds optimal combined approach to accomplishing several projects<br /><br />Portfolio - variety of different programs and subprograms, as well as the possibility of other independent projects.  Programs and projects do not have to be related.<br />   ◇ Maximizes value across programs and projects<br />   ◇ Aligns programs and projects to top-level organizational objectives<br />   ◇ Sets organization-wide policies, procedures, and resource allocations<br>
  <h1 id="Project_Sponsors"><b><u>Project Sponsors</u></b></h1> - often the first stakeholder on a project<br /><br />Role of Project Sponsor may be played by:<br />   ◇ Project Management Office (PMO)<br />   ◇ Individual Sponsor<br />   ◇ Portfolio Director or Representative<br /><br />Project Sponsor must be able to commit resources and provide funding<br /><br />Must sign off on the project charter<br /><br />Sponsor acts as a champion for project throughout its life cycle<br />Ensures necessary rsources for project work are in place<br />Sponsor typically has final say on baseline, milestone approval<br /><br />Project Charters - come about due to analysis of internal needs and external influences.  What drives us at an organizational level, and pressures us externally.  This leads to:<br />   ◇ Analysis of those needs leads to a business case being developed. <br />      ▪ What needs to be accomplished is outlined in the business case, along with a plan of attack<br />   ◇ End result is a Project Chartering document.  Operates as a contract between the project team and the outside or inside client<br />   ◇ Authored and driven forward by project sponsor; may be assisted by a project manager depending on timing<br />   ◇ Best to bring in a project manager during project charter development<br />   ◇ Once sponsor signs off on charter, the project is officially initiated<br>
  <h1 id="Project_Coordination"><b><u>Project Coordination</u></b></h1><br /><br />Project Manager typically coordinates all project activities<br />   ◇ Project coordinators assist project managers in conducting these duties<br />   ◇ Project schedulers specialize in developing, communicating, and maintaining project schedules<br />   ◇ Coordinators and schedulers typically present only on large projects<br />   ◇ Project Management teams include these roles, as well as supporting staff<br /><br />Project management:<br />   ◇ Handles communications with stakeholders and project team<br />   ◇ Manages project scope, budget, schedule, risk, and quality<br />   ◇ Collects and catalogs PROJECT ARTIFACTS<br />      ▪ Project plans<br />      ▪ Documents and reports<br />      ▪ Policies and templates<br />      ▪ Meeting agendas<br />      ▪ Diagrams and visualizations<br>
